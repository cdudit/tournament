# Tournament starter - PHP

Using Symfony 5.3.

## Installation

You need a working PHP 7 version already installed.

You should also install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Symfony cli](https://symfony.com/download)

## Launching server

> symfony server:start

## Launching tests

I unfortunately did not find a way to launch the integrated test tool.

However, you can run:

> php bin/phpunit
